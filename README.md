## Hi, I'm Yunho 👋

> pronounced like `you-know`!

I am an engineer who is passionate about tackling underserved problems. 

### 🔭 I’m working on

- XR-Robot-Teleop-[Server](https://github.com/yunho-c/xr-robot-teleop-server)/[Client](https://github.com/yunho-c/xr-robot-teleop-client) — a great open-source robot teleoperation software stack.
- [PoDoFo](https://github.com/yunho-c/podofo) — an open source, feature-packed PDF app for modern working professionals.
- [Audiobookify](https://github.com/yunho-c/audiobookify) — an open source audiobook generator (TTS) with extremely high quality voices that runs fully on-device. 

### ⏳ I used to work on

- [SightWise](https://sightwise.com/) – a startup dedicated to building best-in-class assistive technologies for the blind and visually impaired.
- [Alt Text Wizard](https://) – a browser extension that generates alt text in real time using multimodal LLMs.
- A bunch of other (hopefully) [interesting side projects](https://github.com/yunho-c?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=)!

### 🛠️ I’m good(?) at...

I am a generalist with a diverse set of interests—and love delving into new, unfamiliar sub-fields of engineering *all of the time*.

That said, my "area of expertise" (in which I spent enough time to build substantial skillsets) are: 
- inference optimization of machine learning algorithms (for on-device / edge inference)
- training and tuning of large transformer models, and infusing different encoders for multi-modality (e.g., 3D point cloud)
- building software systems in general (web, app, backend/database, CLI tools, and a hint of systems-level programs)

### ❤️‍🔥 I love working with

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with

- Simplifying the process of porting ML models to web/mobile environments
- Studying [Apache TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm), compilers, and high-performance computing
- How to be less perfectionistic (& risk-averse) and more efficient

### 🌠 I envision...

My life goal is to contribute to the world by working on things that deserve—but fail to—catch the attention of the industry.

So far, I have encountered a few important topics that fit into this description in my life: 

- **Access to high-quality knowledge content for non-English speakers**
  - An unfair amount of academic lectures and articles are strictly available in English.
  - We are equipped with powerful machine translation technologies as a society, but these have not been deployed to end-user tools to where people can comfortably translate textbooks, lectures, and assignments to learn in their own language.

- **Assistive technologies that can enhance the quality of life of individuals with sensory impairments**
  - The world we live in are not designed with sensory impairment in mind. This includes roads, products, interfaces, even schools and public buildings.
    - Our society presents loads more challenges and safety risks for them, while offering them less opportunity for success (e.g., in schools / jobs). 
  - We have **lots** of room for improvement in this end, as a society and as a field (of engineering).
    - A part of this are societal/infrastructural issues, but modern technology has a lot to offer to help with respect to frustrations that commonly arise during [activities of daily living (ADLs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living).
  - For example: visual impairment is a lot more common than people realize, and a lot more detrimental than people realize.
    - I am not putting as much time into building visual assistance systems as I did before, but I am going to continue until it is truly considered "solved".
    - Projects like [Project Astra](https://deepmind.google/models/project-astra/) are very exciting!

I plan to keep working really hard on stuff like this. 

If I can ever build a product with a positive societal impact like the [Dot Pad](https://pad.dotincorp.com), I will consider my life a big success on my deathbed.
